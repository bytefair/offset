Offset is a theme that's meant for you to edit directly. It comes with plenty of front-end development hotness installed via Bower and Grunt and I eventually hope to make a Yo generator for it as well. If you want to change the development stack, consult the Gruntfile.

Offset uses inspiration and code from Automattic's Underscores theme located at http://underscores.me
