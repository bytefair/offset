# Offset

Offset is a WordPress starter kit that works with Bower/Grunt.

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.3+ with Composer
2. NPM
3. Ruby 1.9+

## Special Directories

/images - PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs in placed in here will be minified
/js - run through JSHint and Uglify

## Understanding Functions

## Recommended Plugins

Since this theme is meant to be compatible with Bedrock, you should be using [WPackagist](http://wpackagist.org) to manage your WP.org plugins through Composer. For that reason, I've not included any sort of activation script to auto-install plugins but there are a few I would suggest you consider.

* Nice Search - <http://wordpress.org/plugins/nice-search/>
* Advanced Custom Fields - <http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/>
* Pods - <http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/>
* Slim Jetpack - <https://wordpress.org/plugins/slimjetpack/>
